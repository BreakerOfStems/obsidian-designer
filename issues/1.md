### Summary

Introduce a small constraints system to describe intent under resizing and different aspect ratios.

### Motivation

LLMs and downstream runtimes need explicit constraints to avoid copying design-time pixels.

### Requirements
- Add optional layout.constraints object supporting:
  - pin: { left?: bool, right?: bool, top?: bool, bottom?: bool, centerX?: bool, centerY?: bool }
  - minW/maxW/minH/maxH (px)
  - aspectLock?: number | null (e.g. 1.777 for 16:9)
  - safeArea?: bool
  - scaleMode?: "fixed" | "fit" | "fill"
- Ensure constraints are preserved across copy/paste and serialization.

### Acceptance Criteria
- At least one demo screen uses constraints (e.g. pinned header + flexible content).
- Constraints round-trip (save/load) without loss.
